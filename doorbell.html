            <p>
                To create this project, we need a microcontroller chip, a sensor, a breadboard,
                a breadboard power supply can help, some dupont wires, and a computer to program on.
                The list of items for this project was even created by GPT.
            </p>
            <h3>List of hardware:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Microcontroller: AITRIP ESP-WROOM-32 from Amazon.</li>
                <li>Breadboard: Any (Just make sure it is a decent one. Some are badly made.)</li>
                <li>Dupont wires: Any (To connect our components without any soldering.)</li>
                <li>Computer: Any (Should be able to handle visual studio code.)</li>
                <li>
                    Breadboard power supply: Not needed if you use a model that has a USB type C, but if you
                    want to test unplugged from your computer then it is needed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="warning">
                <strong>Note:</strong> Make sure to be careful. If you cannot do this without shocking yourself or
                starting a fire, do not proceed.

                    This is my setup for the wiring of the components. It uses 3.3v to power ESP-32 and 5v
                    to power the sensor, and I have the grounds connected. To power, you need a battery and the
                    connector that came with the power supply to connect the battery to the power supply or just
                    plug into the PC, and it will work while wired.
